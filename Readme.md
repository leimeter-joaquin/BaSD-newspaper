## Objective
### week 5
to crate a form page using the same styles that we have on index.html.
The form must be responsive and it has to validate all inputs following cetain rules.

### week 6
We have to make it so that when the form is validated, we send the information to the server:. Then we get back an object with the user info. We save this information in Local Storage and fill the inputs on load.

## To visualize
Open index.html or subscription.html on any browser. You can navigate between the two clicking on "home" and "subscription"
